# Concierge

`concierge` is a simple Slackbot I wrote for internal team use at [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com). The inspiration was derived from my time working at [Auth0](https://auth0.com) and using Auth0's extremely useful concierge Slackbot.

## Usage

* `@concierge assign [@user]` assigns someone to concierge for the channel the message was sent in
* `@concierge clear` removes the current assignment for the channel
* `@concierge who` reports the name of the assigned concierge in the current channel
* `@concierge help` shows the list of available commands
* `@concierge [some other message]` sends a direct message to the concierge for the channel, notifying them that your message needs attention

## Development

**Prerequisite**: A Slack workspace that you can test in (without disturbing or spamming your coworkers ðŸ˜›). You can [create a new Slack workspace for free here](https://slack.com/get-started#/create).

1. [Create a new Slack app](https://api.slack.com/apps/new).
2. Name your app `Slack App Name` and select your preferred development Slack workspace.
3. Install the app to your team workspace.
4. Clone this repository locally.
5. Rename the `.env_sample` file to `.env` and add the appropriate configuration.
6. From your cloned directory, run `$ npm install` to install dependencies.
7. Run `$ npm start` to start the app on the port you specified in your `.env` file.
8. Download and use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) to expose a public URL for your local web server.
9. Once you have ngrok pointing to your Slack app's local development environment, enable Event Subscriptions for your Slack app in the App settings. For the Request URL, provide `https://your-ngrok-url/slack/events`.

## Usage Ideas

Here are some ways you can use the `concierge` bot in conjunction with other Slack features.

### Rotating the Concierge

If your concierge responsibility rotates through several people, you can set a recurring reminder with Slack's `/remind` slash command to remind the concierge to assign the next person. E.g.:

```
/remind [#channel] Assign the next person in the @concierge rotation using `@concierge assign [@user]` every Monday
```
